# Web Traffic Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting website traffic using time series models like ARIMA and Facebook Prophet.

## Overview

The goal is to accurately predict future website visits using historical data. The notebook (`Joy_Project.ipynb`) performs the following steps:

- Load and visualize time series data
- Preprocess and clean missing values
- Fit forecasting models:
  - ARIMA / SARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
- Evaluate performance (e.g., MAPE, RMSE)
- Plot actual vs predicted traffic
